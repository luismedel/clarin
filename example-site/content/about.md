Clarin is a simple, zero-dependency, dogmatic static website generator written as a single C# source file.

Clarin takes a directory with content files and templates and renders them into a static HTML website. No more. No less.

## Overview

Clarin isnâ€™t flexible, nor optimized for speed, ease of use or configurability.
It was modelled to satisfy *[my](https://luismedel.com)* personal needs and preferences (which could be yours' too if you're lucky enough!)

* I don't want to mess with runtimes, containers, databases nor a dependency tree.
* I don't want to study a new templating system, a npm/yarn/bundler/whatever based build system, how to integrate with LESS...and whatnot, only to know if a generator is suited for me.
* I only want to take a bunch of .html or .md files and get them converted to a site, with minimal effort and complexity *from the start*.

Websites built with Clrain can be deployed **anywhere**.
